"""RemoteDisplayClient: push voice-loop events to a WebDashboard running on a
different machine, over HTTP — the "remote" `--display` kind (see
demo/display/__init__.py's build_display).

Why this exists: the voice loop, its memories, and its camera/mic/motors now
run ON the robot, but the architecture keeps
the audience's screen on the Mac (already in front of the room, costs the
CM4 nothing) — so a DisplaySink's events (heard text, replies, recalled
frames) have to LEAVE this process instead of being broadcast in-process the
way demo/display/web.py's WebDashboard does for the older, local/debug
`--display web` mode. The receiving side is that same WebDashboard, run
standalone on the Mac (`python -m demo.display.web`) with its own `/push`
endpoint (see that module) accepting exactly the (event, data) pairs sent
here, and re-broadcasting them over SSE precisely as if they had been
generated in-process.

The dashboard is DECORATIVE, not load-bearing — killing the Mac's dashboard
must not stop the robot remembering — so every push here is fire-and-forget off a background worker thread reading
a bounded, drop-oldest queue: a slow or dead Mac must never stall the voice
loop's own turn (VAD, recall, speech), the same reasoning demo/run_demo.py's
RobotDispatcher already applies to robot motor calls, and WebDashboard's own
`_broadcast` applies to its SSE subscriber queues. A sustained outage
degrades to "the dashboard falls behind, then catches up" — never "the queue
grows without bound" or "a turn waits on a network call to a screen no one
needs for the demo to work".

The same dashboard also holds the three buttons, on its `/control` endpoint:
the pause and the restart are read from here by the voice loop (the methods
below), and the Stream button is read by demo/stage.py through the two module
functions — one place assembles this dashboard's URLs, whichever process is
asking.
