"""The vector store every memory sits on: Qdrant Edge, in-process.

Qdrant Edge is a separate product from the `qdrant-client` package — an
embedded engine (Rust, via PyO3) that runs *inside* this process with no
server, no port and no network. That is the whole premise of the demo: the
robot's memory lives on the robot, and nothing it has seen leaves the device.

The robot keeps three shards, one per lifecycle:

    memory/     what it lived through — named vectors `text` (bge, 384) and
                `image` (SigLIP2, 768); exchanges carry `text`, frames carry
                `image` and, once described, `text`; told apart by `kind`
    people/     who it has met — `face` (HSFace, 512) as a multivector: one
                point per person, every shot of their face in it
    knowledge/  what it was taught — `text` (bge, 384), restored from a
                snapshot on every start

This module adapts the Edge API once for all of them. Points are named by
UUID, so two memories writing into one shard never hand out the same id, and
every shard call goes through one lock: the voice loop and the scene writer
use the same shard from different threads.
